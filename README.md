# RockPaperScissors
This is just a short introductory project, written by me and for me, to introduce myself to programming in Java.
Compile the .java file and run it; it will prompt you to enter either "rock", "paper" or "scissors". After you have done so, the program will tell you what your opponent played, and whether you have won the game. If you enter a different input, the program will inform you that you have provided an invalid input.
